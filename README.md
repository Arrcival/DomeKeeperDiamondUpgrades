A small mod to add a new ore and its upgrades on Dome Keeper

You can use diamonds for almost every dome/keeper/gadgets.
Those upgrades can be bought multiples times or an infinite times.

This breaks the balance of the game, so you cannot do prestige runs with this mod.

Everything in the game should treat diamonds as a normal ressource like : probe detecting diamond, prospection meter detection (new upgrade for diamond), lift orbs carrying diamonds...
